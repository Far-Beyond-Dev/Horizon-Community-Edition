# Leverage a cache mount to /usr/local/cargo/registry/
# for downloaded dependencies, a cache mount to /usr/local/cargo/git/db
# for git repository dependencies, and a cache mount to /app/target/ for
# compiled dependencies which will speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage a bind mount to the src directory to avoid having to copy the
# source code into the container. Once built, copy the executable to an
# output directory before the cache mounted /app/target is unmounted.

# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal
# runtime dependencies for the application. This often uses a different base
# image from the build stage where the necessary files are copied from the build
# stage.
#
# The example below uses the alpine image as the foundation for running the app.
# By specifying the "3.18" tag, it will use version 3.18 of alpine. If
# reproducability is important, consider using a digest
# (e.g., alpine@sha256:664888ac9cfd28068e062c991ebcff4b4c7307dc8dd4df9e728bedde5c449d91).
